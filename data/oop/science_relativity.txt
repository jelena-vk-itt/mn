Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized physics. It consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially near the speed of light, revealing that time and space are interconnected. General relativity expands this, describing how massive objects warp spacetime, leading to phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves.
